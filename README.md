# Door Study — GitHub Pages + Google Sheets

The game logs prompt exposure, exact wording, suggestion, chosen door, correctness, compliance, reaction time, health, score, maze completion, visibility changes, and session summaries. Random prompt assignment is per session. Uploads are batched, persisted locally, deduplicated, and acknowledged by a separate receipt request. Sessions without an end event remain incomplete; browser closure cannot guarantee delivery.

Local preview: `python3 -m http.server 8765 --directory docs`, then open http://localhost:8765. With no endpoint, this is a local-data-only demo. Open through HTTP instead of double-clicking the HTML file.
